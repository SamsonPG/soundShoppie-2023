Headphones Shop Website
Welcome to my Headphones Shop Website! This project is my first and independent endeavor to create a user-friendly platform for all your headphone needs. I have incorporated various features and technologies to ensure a seamless shopping experience and prioritize the security of your transactions. Let's explore the key aspects of my website:

Features
OTP Login: To enhance security, I have implemented a one-time password (OTP) login system. This ensures that your authentication process is secure and reliable.

Extensive Product Listings: My website showcases a wide range of headphones available for purchase. Each product listing provides detailed information such as brand, price, specifications, and customer reviews. It allows you to make informed decisions and find the perfect pair of headphones.

Exciting Category-Based Offers: I understand the excitement of a great deal! To enhance your shopping experience, I offer special discounts and attractive deals on specific headphone categories. This way, you can explore different categories while enjoying significant savings.

Irresistible Offer Prices: I present prominently discounted prices for products that are currently on sale or part of a promotional campaign. Take advantage of these offers to get your favorite headphones at an excellent price.

Seamless Cart Management: Managing your shopping cart is effortless on my website. You can easily add headphones, review the items in your cart, and proceed to checkout without any hassle.

Secure Payment Options: Your security is my utmost priority. I support multiple payment gateways, including PayPal and Razorpay, to provide you with secure and convenient payment options. Choose the method that suits you best and complete your transactions with confidence.

Cash on Delivery (COD) Option: I understand that some customers prefer the flexibility of cash on delivery. To accommodate this preference, I offer a cash on delivery (COD) option. Simply select this method during checkout if it suits your needs.

Order Tracking: Once you've placed an order, I want to keep you informed every step of the way. You can easily track the status of your shipment and receive updates on the expected delivery dates.

Tech Stack
To bring you the best experience possible, I have utilized the following technologies:

MongoDB: I use this powerful NoSQL database to securely store and manage product details, user information, and order data.

Express.js: As a web application framework for Node.js, Express.js forms the backbone of my server-side logic and API endpoints.

Node.js: This JavaScript runtime environment enables me to run server-side code and handle client requests efficiently.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): I have leveraged EJS as an embedded templating language. It seamlessly integrates JavaScript code within HTML, allowing me to create dynamic views and render data on the client-side.

Mongoose: Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, assists in data modeling and facilitates interactions with the MongoDB database.

HTML/CSS: I have utilized HTML and CSS to craft a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

JavaScript: JavaScript plays a vital role in my project, enabling client-side interactions and dynamic functionality.
